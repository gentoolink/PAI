## ðŸŽ­ The Full Story

### The Problem We Encountered

Sol (the AI) tried to edit a file that wasn't included in the conversational context, which resulted in an error message from the system.

### What We Initially Thought

We thought that Sol could edit any file on the system as long as the correct path was known.

This led us to believe the system worked in a certain way, and we approached the problem with these assumptions.

### What We Discovered Was Actually True

What we realized was that Sol can only edit files that are explicitly provided in the context for the current turn. It's like only being able to write on documents placed on the table in front of us.

This was different from our initial understanding and required us to rethink our approach.

### The Journey: Troubleshooting Steps We Took

The system returned an error: `The code change produced by Gemini cannot be applied because [filename] was not included in the context. Try manually adding it with @filename.` We then discussed what this meant, and the user re-issued the command with the file included.

These steps helped us uncover the real issue and guided us toward the solution.

### The Solution That Worked

The user re-issued the request and manually included the target file in the prompt using the `@filename` syntax. This placed the file "on the table," allowing Sol to successfully apply the required edits.

This solution addressed the actual problem rather than what we initially thought was wrong.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Lesson Learned

**So now we know:** To have Sol edit a file, it must be included in the prompt's context using the `@` symbol.

This changes how we approach similar problems in the future because we understand the underlying mechanism better.

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference

**Before:** We thought Sol could edit any file by its path...

**After:** We know Sol can only edit files included in the prompt with `@`...

**Action:** Always include files to be edited in the prompt context.
